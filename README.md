# skiply
Small concept food delivery app. To showcase what I learned in my internship at Syenchron.

Skiply because you're skipping restaurant lines or something ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## theoretical improvements

- get a logo
  - maybe it can change depending on people's tastes
- change the name, might be taken by something else, but it's a pretty nice name tbh
- menu screen can look better, maybe make it a list with details on the side and icons for spice levels etc.

## things i've learned

- flexboxes are a godsend
- so easy to make stylesheets with figma
